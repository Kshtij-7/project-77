        <h1>Project On Console</h1>
        <p>Visual Studio code, also known as vscode, is a programing platform by Microsoft for programing outside the browsers on any platform! It can be downloaded on the official website for free.</p>
        <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com/download' target="_blank"> Download link for any platform</a>
        <p>Console is a screen where the code can be tested, without making it public, to catch errrors etc 
            <br> To print anything in the console use console.log('TEXT HERE') 
            <br> To see the console on the browser first inspect the page[Ctrl + Shift + I] then go to the console over there </p>
